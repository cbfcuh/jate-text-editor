# JATE Text Editor

## Description
This web-based text editor allows users to write and save text directly within the application for future use. It is a single-page application that meets Progressive Web Application (PWA) standards, incorporating multiple data persistence strategies to ensure data redundancy, whether the browser lacks certain features or the user is offline. Additionally, users can install the application on their devices and use it outside of the browser. The project is deployed on Render. Through this project, I gained valuable experience in developing PWAs and implementing efficient methods for data storage and retrieval.
